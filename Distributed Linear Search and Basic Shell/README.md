# Simulating Virtual memory through (pure) demand paging
**Distributed Linear Search (DLS)** : In DLS, the array is split up into
subarrays and searching the sub-arrays in delegated to other processes (hence
distributed).

**Basic Shell**: The shell is a program that interprets commands and acts as an
intermediary between the user and the inner workings of the operating system  and
as such is arguably one of the most important parts of a Unix system.
In this, a basic version of a Unix shell is implemented.

The complete problem overview is given in *problem.pdf*.


Commands to use to run the program:
-----------------------------------
* Compile all files

  ```
  make all
  ```

* Clean all files

  ```
  make clean
  ```

* Run

**Distributed Linear Search (DLS)**
  ```
  ./dls input.txt <search interger>
  ```

**Basic Shell**
  ```
  ./simplesh
  ```
