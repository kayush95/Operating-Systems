# Implementing Terminal Mirroring using message queue
Implementation of a system for multiple terminals which interact
with each other using message queues. The commands on a given terminal (shell), will be
mirrored in the coupled terminal along with output.

**Server**: The system will have a server, which will start a message queue. It will also maintain
the list of client terminals which joins the coupling. The server will be started first which will
maintain the message queue and the coupling list. After receiving message from a client for
the group, it sends the message to all the members of the group.

**Client**: The client program will have an interface similar to that of the shell assignments (as
in Assignment 1&2). The programs will share a message queue, through which you can
communicate among with the other terminals (via the server). There is a joining protocol to
the terminal mirroring. This protocol will add the members to the list of terminals sharing
their screen (like Team Viewer for GUI). After a terminal joins the group all the commands
and the relevant outputs will be broadcasted to all the members which has joined the group.


The complete problem overview and protocols are given in *problem.pdf*.


Commands to use to run the program:
-----------------------------------
* Compile

  ```
  make server
  make client
  ```

* Clean all files

  ```
  make clean
  ```

* Run

In one terminal
  ```
  sudo ./server
  ```

Then open ```m``` terminals. Run ```./client``` in each one of them to create ```m``` clients. Follow the joining protocol and commands which are given in *problem.pdf*.
