# Distributed Prime Generation and Advanced Shell
**Distributed Prime Generation** :  Distributed prime checking using signal and pipes

**Advanced Shell**: The shell is a program that interprets commands and acts as an
intermediary between the user and the inner workings of the operating system  and
as such is arguably one of the most important parts of a Unix system.
In this, new functionalities have been added to the previous basic shell.

The complete problem overview is given in *problem.pdf*.


Commands to use to run the program:
-----------------------------------
* Compile all files

  ```
  make all
  ```

* Clean all files

  ```
  make clean
  ```

* Run

**Distributed Prime Generation**
  ```
  ./primpipe N K
  ```
 Here ```N``` and ```K``` are integers.


**Advanced Shell**
  ```
  ./advshell
  ```
